#JS Developer test

##Client side Address book
Build a single page address book application using javascript, html & css only.

###Functionality
1. You should be able to add, delete and edit contacts.
2. The data shall be stored in local storage, and loaded from storage onload.
3. Add fitting validation to the different input fields.

###Mandatory fields
* First name
* Last name
* Email
* Address
* City
* Zip-code
* Country

### Frameworks/Libraries
You should use angular.js as framework when creating the application.
Do not use jQuery.

### Misc

Even though this is a small project, structure and architecture should mimic a bigger project.
Use all the power of angular.js, but code-wise it should be as little dependent on it as possible.


**Good Luck! :-)**
