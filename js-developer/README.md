#JS Developer test

## Client Side Address Book
Build a single page address book application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Functionality
1. You should be able to add, delete and edit contacts.
2. The data shall be stored in local storage, and loaded again when the application starts.
3. Add fitting validation to the different input fields.

### Mandatory Fields
* First name
* Last name
* Email
* Address
* City
* Zip-code
* Country

### Frameworks/Libraries
* The application must be build with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* You must **not** use jQuery!

### Misc
Even though this is a small project, structure and architecture should mimic a bigger project.
Use all the power of Angular, but code-wise it should be as little dependent on it as possible.  
The application shuold work in latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE.

**Good Luck! :-)**
